My repository for a personal site that I wanted to work on. Currently using Bootstrap foundations for my layout, while also developing using HTML, CSS, Sass, jQuery, and Javascript. Presented in a neat, divided, single-page layout. 

Adding more sophisticated Javascript and jQuery will be main objective, as well as establishing my brand. 

Enjoy!
